# CrownPizza

This project used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and MySQL to create a web application for ordering pizza. 
Pizza menus may be perused, orders can be placed, order history can be viewed, and users can successfully register and log in. 
Managing pizza listings and checking customer orders are examples of admin capabilities. 
Visual Studio Code and XAMPP for local MySQL database administration were used in the development of the application.
